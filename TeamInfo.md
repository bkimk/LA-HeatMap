## Project Summary

Our project aims to give users a visual heat map representation of the crime within Los Angeles. With a simple click on the map or the input of an address, the application will select that specific location and give more extensive information in regards to the crime that typically occurs there. This will allow users to accurately determine the risk when traveling to specific locations through crime rate, severity, and time of day.
